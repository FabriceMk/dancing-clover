  "description": "This well known polka set is danced by the Ballybunion Set Dancers.\nDance description from Toss the Feathers by Pat Murphy. Reproduced by permission.\nChanges have been made to match how this has been danced in Kerry and by the Ballybunion set dancers. Most notably the 1st sides are on the right rather than the left and there’s no house in the 3rd figure.  If you use the music by Matt Cunningham you’ll find that the music is 8 bars longer than necessary without the house, though the music by Shaskeen is the 'correct' length.\nFirst side couple is on the right of the first top couple.",
