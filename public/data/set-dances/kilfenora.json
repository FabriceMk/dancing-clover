  "description": "This plain set, which was danced mostly to quadrille music around Kilfenora in previous times, was passed by Michael Slattery of Kilfenora. A written description of the movements as the set was danced were given to the late John Byrt by his uncle Tom Byrt in 1963. John’s brother George is a noted piano and keyboard player with various Clare Ceili Bands over many years. These notes were found in John’s house when he passed away in 1975 and they were given to Michael Slattery by John Byrt’s son Enda. Description from Apples In Winter by Pat Murphy.",
